## Motivation

Personal security is always a concern for citizens, especially in their home space. Moreover, access clearance to a particular space can be crucial in safeguarding a "safe space." For example, with many households' doors being left unlocked by mistake, many have been exposed to burglary due to their mistakes. Unfortunately, most existing IoT solutions with "smart" sensors and cloud-based services are often expensive for low-income households, making installing and acquiring this technology unattainable. Moreover, most existing IOT solutions also require a tedious installation of specialized locks into their doors.

To make this technology more accessible, this project aims to create a product solution for such a case by building a mechanical locking device with "onboard" software for facial recognition and an automated locking mechanism. Furthermore, as an extra feature, the proposed product can create a local house guest directory to enable additional authorized users to access the space without needing an extra physical key copy.

Similar to the protection many smartphones have today, this mechanism can provide additional security to the household while being designed as a poka-yoke case for circumstances where users may need to leave the household and not worry about locking the door. The proposed project will consider an automated mechanism to lock doors using optical sensors and timeout protocols based on internally collected data on the onboard chip. The proposed mechanisms should not interfere with the regular functions of the door in case of product malfunctions or lack of electricity.

In addition, part of this project's goal is to understand and build a communication protocol for storing the data and onboard model updating without the need for constant internet communication. This approach alleviates the need for a continuous internet connection. Moreover, the components utilized by such a product promise low electricity consumption, allowing continuous usage without noticeable increases in electricity bills paid by users.
